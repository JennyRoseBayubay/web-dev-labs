        <h1 class="text-center mt-4">Welcome to the Utility Playground</h1>

        
        <div class="bg-warning p-4 mb-3">
            This is a box with a warning background color, padding of 4 units, and a bottom margin of 3 units.
            It showcases Bootstrap's background, padding, and margin utilities.
        </div>

        
        <p class="d-none d-md-block">
            This paragraph is hidden on extra-small and small screens (d-none),
            but it becomes visible on medium screens (md) and larger (d-md-block).
            Try resizing your browser window to see its responsiveness!
        </p>

        <p class="d-block d-md-none text-danger mt-3">
            (You're seeing this text because you're on a small screen where the responsive paragraph above is hidden.)
